### Tehran Traffic Map to Youtube Video

This program generates videos of [Tehran Traffic Map](http://31.24.237.150/TTCCTrafficWebSite/PublicUsers/GraphicalTrafficMap/Default.aspx) and uploads it to Youtube. Videos are created on daily basis.

### Tehran Traffic Map images

Traffic Map images are available as JPEG files on Tehran Traffic Control Web Server (file extention in URL is incorrectly specified as PNG). This is an example of a traffic map downloaded in rush hour:
